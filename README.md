## Getting Started

To start learning Java, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install the latest version of Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official Oracle website: [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

2. Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that suits your preferences. Some popular options are:
   - Eclipse: [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
   - IntelliJ IDEA: [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
   - NetBeans: [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html)

3. Set up your IDE by configuring the JDK and creating a new Java project.

4. Clone or download this repository to access the learning resources and code examples.

## Java Basics

In the `basics` folder of this repository, you'll find examples and exercises covering the fundamental concepts of Java programming, including:

- Variables and data types
- Operators
- Control flow (if-else statements, loops)
- Arrays and collections
- Input and output

Feel free to explore the examples and modify the code to experiment and solidify your understanding of these concepts.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Java is an object-oriented language, and mastering object-oriented programming (OOP) is essential. In the `oop` folder, you'll find examples that demonstrate:

- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Encapsulation and data hiding

These examples will help you understand how to design and implement robust and reusable Java code using OOP principles.

## Core Libraries

Java provides a vast array of core libraries for various purposes. In the `libraries` folder, you'll find examples that demonstrate the usage of some commonly used libraries, including:

- java.util: Collections, data structures, and utilities
- java.io: Input and output operations
- java.lang: Fundamental classes and exceptions

These examples will help you leverage the power of Java's core libraries to build efficient and feature-rich applications.

## IDE Recommendations

While you can choose any IDE that supports Java development, here are a few recommendations:

- Eclipse: A popular and versatile Java IDE with a rich set of features and extensive plugin support.
- IntelliJ IDEA: A powerful IDE with intelligent code completion, refactoring tools, and excellent support for Java development.
- NetBeans: A user-friendly IDE with a comprehensive feature set and strong support for Java development.

Feel free to explore different IDEs and choose the one that suits your needs and preferences.

## Resources

Here are some additional resources to further your Java learning journey:

- Oracle Java Documentation: Official documentation for Java SE, including language features and core libraries. [Java SE Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/index.html)
- Java Tutorials by Oracle: A comprehensive set of tutorials covering various aspects of Java programming. [Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial

/index.html)
- MOOC Courses: Online courses such as Coursera's "Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals" or edX's "Java Programming Basics" can provide structured learning opportunities.
